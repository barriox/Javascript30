      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];
      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      console.log(players);
      const players2 = players;
      // however what happens when we update that array?
      console.log(players, players2);
      // now here is the problem!
      players2[1] = "Laura";
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      console.log(players, players2);
      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const players3 = players.slice();
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const players4 = [...players];
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      players3[1] = "Max";
      console.log(players, players3);

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };
      console.log(person);
      // and think we make a copy:
      const person2 = person;
      person2.age = 45;
      console.log(person, person2);
      // but again, we have a reference, not a copy!
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const person3 = { ...person };
      const person4 = { ...person, age: 20 };
      console.log(person, person3, person4);
